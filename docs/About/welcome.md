# Introduction

## What is Newrl?

Newrl is a blockchain built for infinite scaling unlike current public blockchains. It mimics the architecture of the human brain, which is great at optimizing resources even in a decentralized setup. We achieve superior contract adherence through a blockchain infrastructure that uses social capital of the participants and smart contracts with tokenized real-world assets.

Newrl is a ‘trust network’ - a highly scalable, memory-aware and multi-token blockchain with a rich protocol layer of template-driven transaction types, smart contracts and DAOs. It is focused on effective tokenization of real-world assets/contracts and their frictionless financing on-chain - ready to be used in institutional as well as DAO-based setups.
